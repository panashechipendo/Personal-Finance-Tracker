# Personal Finance Tracker

This is a command-line application for tracking personal finances, created for the CS50P Final Project.

## My Thoughts

This was my first fully functional CLI script made using Python and it was a great learning experience. I wanted to do something that ran on the command line while at the same time wasn't a generic task manager app so I settled for a finance tracker that could export csv and excel files for use in other apps.

The challenges I faced while making this were mostly identifying the right packages to use to make my workflow cleaner and edge-cases.... A lot of edge cases. This forced me to think of many scenarios where the input could be wrong and how to properly calculate  or convert the input into proper types and pass them into other functions.

Overall I would say I had a great time making this CLI tool and hope others will find it fun or useful. 

My future plans for it would be to a add a UI but thats in the distant future....
